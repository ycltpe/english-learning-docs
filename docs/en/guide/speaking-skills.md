# Speaking Skills

## Output Path

Shadowing → retell → templated expressions → free speaking

## From Shadowing to Free Speaking

- Mimic: 1-min clip × 10 times; focus on rhythm and intonation
- Retell: with outline → without outline
- Substitute: replace names/scenes with your context
- Extend: add 2–3 details on top of the retell

## Useful Patterns

- Openers/Structure: Firstly/Secondly/Finally; In my view; The reason is ...
- Concession/Contrast: While A, it is also true that B; That said, ...
- Examples: For example; In practice; A case in point is ...
- Wrap-up: To sum up; The takeaway is ...

## Pronunciation & Fluency

- Focus: stress, linking, reduction before letter-by-letter
- Fluency: reduce backtracking; use “fillers” to buy time
- Intelligibility: keep key words clear; avoid overlong sentences

## 15-Min Session

- Shadow 6× (3× segmented + 3× full)
- Retell 2× (record)
- Topic speaking 2 min (use 3–5 target expressions)
- Self-review and notes
