# Goal Setting

## SMART

- Specific: target exact skills and contexts (e.g., “business meeting speaking”)
- Measurable: minutes, word counts, accuracy, scores
- Achievable: based on your current level and past performance
- Relevant: tied to real-life scenarios
- Time-bound: 4–12 week cycles with weekly reviews

## Sample Goals

- Speaking: deliver a 5-min update and answer 3 follow-ups at work in 12 weeks
- Listening: understand 80% of BBC 6 Minute English in 8 weeks and retell key points
- Writing: write 200 words with < 5 errors per 100 words in 6 weeks
- Vocabulary: 800 high-frequency words in 4 weeks (SRS maturity > 70%)

## Weekly/Daily Breakdown

- Weekly:
  - Shadowing 5×15 min
  - Speaking 2×10 min
  - 1 writing task (150–200 words)
  - 150–200 new words
  - 2 intensive reads + 3 extensive reads

- Daily (60 min example):
  - Vocabulary 15 min (20–30 new + review)
  - Listening/Shadowing 15 min (1–2 min clip)
  - Reading 20 min (intensive/extensive)
  - Output 10 min (speaking/writing)

## Milestones

- Week 2: 7 consecutive learning days; 100 total shadow reps
- Week 4: 1-min self-intro without notes
- Week 8: 180-word paragraph with clear structure
- Week 12: 5-min conversation on familiar topics

## Risks & Mitigation

- Overload → halve tasks but keep consistency
- Materials too hard → move to i+1 (80–90% understandable)
- No feedback → use recording/tools + peer review
