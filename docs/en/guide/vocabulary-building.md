# Vocabulary Building

## Principles

- Frequency first: Oxford 3000/COCA before niche lists
- Collocations first: phrases > single words
- Reusability: put words into patterns and contexts
- Reviewability: use SRS (Anki/Quizlet)

## Lists & Sources

- Frequency: Oxford 3000, COCA lists
- Thematic: workplace/academic/daily life
- Corpora: News in Levels/TED-Ed/Economist extracts for expression mining

## Expression Card Template

- Front: phrase/collocation + example (optionally monolingual def)
- Back: hint/near-synonyms/antonyms + 1–2 variations

Example:

```
take initiative to do sth.
I took the initiative to reach out to the client.
→ be proactive in ... / take the lead in ...
```

## Daily Routine (20 min)

- 20–30 new items from today’s input
- 50–100 reviews via SRS
- Output: use 3–5 target expressions in speech/writing

## Tracking

- New cards/day, review completion
- Mature cards ratio (> 70%)
- Weekly usage in outputs
