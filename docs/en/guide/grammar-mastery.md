# Grammar Mastery

## Common Pain Points

- Tense/aspect consistency and perfect tenses
- Conditionals and subjunctive
- Relative/noun/adverbial clauses
- Non-finites (gerund/participle/infinitive)
- Voice and prepositional collocations

## Practice Cycle (15–25 min)

1. Examples: pick 3–5 high-quality sentences (from reliable corpora)
2. Variations: change subject/tense/voice; write 5–8 variants
3. Production: 5–8 sentences within your own context
4. Feedback: tools + corpus contrast + peer review

## Quick Checks

- Clear timeline (past/present/future/perfect)
- Correct clause linkers and references
- Logical subject for non-finites
- Natural collocations (prepositions/fixed phrases)

## Resources

- Practical English Usage (Swan)
- Grammar in Use (Cambridge)
