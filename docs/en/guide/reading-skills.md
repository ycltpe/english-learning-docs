# Reading Skills

## Goals

- Capture main ideas and structure fast
- Accumulate reusable expressions (collocations, patterns, transitions)
- Transfer input to speaking and writing

## Extensive vs Intensive

- Extensive: speed first; mark a few high-value expressions
- Intensive: focus on both structure and language; make expression cards

## Intensive Flow (20–30 min)

1. Skim: title, lead, first sentences
2. Scan: discourse markers and paragraph structure
3. Annotate: keywords, collocations, examples
4. Retell: 3–5 sentences on main ideas
5. Transfer: write 5–8 sentences with the same structure

## Annotation System

- Vocabulary: collocations/fixed phrases/synonyms
- Syntax: clauses/non-finite verbs/parallel and progression
- Structure: topic sentences, supporting sentences, conclusion

## Metrics

- Retell coverage ≥ 80%
- ≥ 3 reusable expressions per piece
- Weekly: 2 intensive + 3 extensive

## Recommended Sources

- News in Levels (graded)
- The Economist Espresso (short, structured)
- Quillette/Medium (argumentative prose)
