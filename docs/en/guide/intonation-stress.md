# Intonation & Stress

## Core Concepts

- Thought groups: cut at commas/pauses
- Sentence stress: content words carry the focus
- Intonation: declaratives/interrogatives/lists/contrastive patterns

## Training

1. Mark thought groups and stress on the text
2. Mimic original rhythm and stress placement
3. Express different attitudes with the same content

## Task (10–15 min)

- Read a 3–5 sentence piece 3 times with different tones
- Record and compare waveform/duration; focus on pauses and stress
