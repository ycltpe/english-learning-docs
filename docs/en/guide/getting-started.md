# Getting Started with English Learning

This guide helps you set up a sustainable learning system in 7 days and see measurable progress in 4–12 weeks.

## Overview Roadmap

- Starter (Week 1–2): Establish habits and toolkit; master pronunciation basics and high-frequency vocabulary.
- Consolidation (Week 3–8): Systematically develop core skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing); close the input–output loop.
- Growth (Week 9–24): Focus on weak areas; do domain-specific training (business/academic/exam); build a personal knowledge base.

## Essential Toolkit

- Vocabulary: Anki/Rememberry + high-frequency lists (Oxford 3000/COCA)
- Listening: Podcasts (ESLPod, VOA, BBC 6 Minute English), YouGlish
- Reading: News in Levels, The Economist Espresso, graded readers
- Writing/Grammar: Grammarly/Languagetool + ChatGPT as a coach
- Speaking: italki/Speak/HelloTalk + Shadowing

## 7-Day Kickoff Plan

Day 1:
- Install tools (Anki, subtitle player, TTS), create decks and a daily routine
- Learn IPA basics and connected speech; record a 30–60s self-intro

Day 2–3:
- 50–80 high-frequency words (with spaced repetition)
- 15 min shadowing (choose a 1-min clip; loop 10–15 times)
- 30 min input (simplified news/graded readers); log 5 expressions

Day 4–5:
- Micro grammar lessons (tenses/voice/clauses, 10–15 min each) + 10–15 practice items
- Retell: summarize today’s material in 3–5 sentences

Day 6–7:
- Output day: write 120–150 words; speak 10 min on a topic (record)
- Retrospect and plan next week (keep what works; adjust what doesn’t)

## Daily Time Budget (40–90 min)

- Vocabulary (Anki): 10–20 min
- Listening + Shadowing: 10–20 min
- Reading input: 15–30 min
- Output (speaking/writing): 10–20 min
- Review & log: 5 min

## Key Principles

- Small, consistent steps: 1–3 min audio; clear, achievable tasks
- Reusable materials: transcripts/bilingual text/explanations help deep practice
- Quantified feedback: SRS maturity, shadowing counts, speaking minutes, word count
- Closed loop: input → process → output → feedback → input

## Starter Materials (Pick One)

- BBC 6 Minute English: short, natural, transcripts available
- VOA Learning English: slower speech, great for foundations
- Netflix/YouTube short videos with subtitles: 1–3 min, perfect for shadowing
- Graded readers: Oxford/Penguin Level 2–4

## Self-Assessment (Day 7)

- Can I consistently complete 40 minutes of learning per day?
- Can I shadow a 1-minute clip ≥ 10 times and get closer to the original?
- Did I write a 120–150 word piece and receive feedback?
- Did I build a deck and stick to reviews?

- Study Plan → create your weekly plan
- Learning Methodology → master the input–output feedback loop
