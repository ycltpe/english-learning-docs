# Listening Skills

## Training Framework

- Intensive listening: with transcript, mark linking/reduction; dictation of key lines
- Shadowing: speak along without reading; align rhythm and intonation
- Retell: summarize in 3–5 sentences to consolidate understanding and output
- Revisit: practice the same material next day to test retention

## Materials & Levels

- Beginner: VOA Learning English, BBC 6 Minute English (with transcripts)
- Intermediate: ESLPod / TED-Ed / News in Levels
- Advanced: The Daily / Economist podcasts
- Rules: 1–3 min, transcript available, adjustable speed, 80–90% understandable

## Six Steps to Intensive Listening

1. Full listen once; write theme and keywords
2. Dictate/retell line-by-line; mark problem spots
3. Compare with transcript; mark linking, reduction, assimilation, stress
4. Vocabulary/expressions → make collocation cards
5. Shadow 10 times (segments → full)
6. Retell once or twice without text (same or next day)

## Shadowing Tips

- Slow to fast: start at 0.8× → 1.0×/1.1×
- Layers: rhythm → linking → stress → intonation → emotion
- Recording: compare waveform/duration to fix pauses and phrasing

## Metrics

- Shadowing reps per material: ≥ 10
- Retell coverage: ≥ 80% key info
- Next-day recall of target words: ≥ 70%
