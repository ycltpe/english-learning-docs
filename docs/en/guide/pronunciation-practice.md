# Pronunciation Practice

## Route

1. Phonemes: vowels/consonants and mouth positions
2. Minimal pairs: /iː/ vs /ɪ/, /æ/ vs /ʌ/, ...
3. Word level: stress and syllables
4. Connected speech: linking, reduction, assimilation, elision

## 15-Min Template

- 5 min: minimal pairs (record and compare)
- 5 min: word stress and syllables (YouGlish search)
- 5 min: sentence-level linking/reduction (with transcripts)

## Self-Check

- Clear vowel shapes and sufficient stretch
- Clear stress and stable rhythm
- Natural linking without hurting intelligibility

## Tools

- ELSA Speak / Elsa AI
- YouGlish (multiple accents)
- Subtitle player + slow playback
