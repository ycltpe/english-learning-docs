# Learning Methodology

## Three Pillars

1. Comprehensible Input (i+1): 80–90% understandable materials
2. Deliberate Practice: clear goals, immediate feedback, focus on weaknesses
3. Feedback Loop: input → process → output → feedback → input

## Four-Step Loop

1. Intensive listening/reading:
   - Sentence-by-sentence with transcript; annotate vocabulary and expressions
   - Retell main ideas in 3–5 sentences
2. Structuring:
   - Build expression cards (collocations/sentence patterns)
   - Record grammar notes as “example + variations”
3. Output:
   - Speaking: shadowing → retell → topic speaking
   - Writing: paragraph imitation → chunked writing → full piece
4. Feedback:
   - Tools: Grammarly/Languagetool/YouGlish/recordings
   - People: partners/teachers/communities

## Task Granularity

- 10–25 minutes per task
- 1–3 min audio or 500–800 words text per material
- Revisit each material 3–5 times minimum

## Common Training Templates

- Shadowing 10×: shadow → compare → fix → shadow again
- Retell 3×: with outline → without outline → record and review
- 150-word writing: imitate structure + self-edit → tool → peer review

## Data-Driven Improvement

- Dashboard: days studied, total minutes, SRS maturity, shadowing count, output word/min
- Optimize one thing per week: e.g., linking, topic sentences, tense consistency
